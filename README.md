## 🎯 Learning Outcome
This was my **first Tableau project**, where I learned:
- How to build an executive-level dashboard  
- How to use Tableau charts, filters, and maps effectively  
- How to present key business metrics in a structured and visual way  

It laid the foundation for my later, more advanced projects (e.g., Online Retail Analysis, E-commerce Performance Dashboard).



## 📌 Next Steps
