## 🎯 Learning Outcome
This was my **first Tableau project**, where I learned:
- How to build an executive-level dashboard  
- How to use Tableau charts, filters, and maps effectively  
- How to present key business metrics in a structured and visual way  

It laid the foundation for my later, more advanced projects (e.g., Online Retail Analysis, E-commerce Performance Dashboard).



## 📌 Next Steps
While this dashboard was created as part of guided learning, it showcases my ability to:
- Apply Tableau training in practice  
- Structure business insights visually  
- Grow from guided learning → independent projects
